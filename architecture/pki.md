# Public Key Infrastructures (PKI)

## What is PKI?

- public key infrastructure
  - a set of roles/policy/hardware/software/procedures needed to create/manage/distribute/use/store/revoke digital certificates

- simple passwords are inadequate for authentication
- PKI binds an identity to a pubkey
    - this is done via registration and deployment of certs by a cert authority (CA)
    - may be done by automation or by hand
    - when done via network there must be a cert management protocol (CMP)
